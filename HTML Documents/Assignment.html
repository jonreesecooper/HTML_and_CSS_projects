		<h1>FINNEGAN</h1>

		<p>Finnegan is a dog of the Italian Greyhuahua breed, but more than that he is the bestest boy.  He has long legs, a boopable nose, and the heart of a saint.</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.101dogbreeds.com/italian-greyhuahua.asp">
			<p>The Italian Greyhuahua is a very small breed of dogs crossed between the Italian Greyhound and the Chihuahua. Like its funny name, this adorable dog has an apple-shaped head studded with dark almond-shaped eyes and ends in a small, black nose.</p>

		<p>Zelda is a tortoise-shell feline.  She is also known as the favorite, the G.O.A.T., and Miss City Kitty 2020.  Her sassy attitude has seen her clear across the country and back, with more adventures to come!</p>
		<blockquote href="https://www.certapet.com/tortoiseshell-cat/">
			<p>The Tortoiseshell cat is one terrific cat made up of a marvelous combination of multiple colors and patterns. They are not a ‘breed’ in themselves. The Tortoiseshell’s coat is what identifies this type of cat. Both pedigree and mixed breed domestic cats can have tortoiseshell fur or coats. They are also unique in that they are usually always female.</p>
